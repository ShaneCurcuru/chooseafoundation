## Code of Conduct for Contributors

This site is run solely by Shane Curcuru, and is meant as a resource for the world to help understand how some community-run open source projects express their Code of Conduct, as well as to provide basic information and options about FOSS CoCs in general.

Contributors and participants in the GitHub project infrastructure are expected to be excellent to each :smiley_cat: :dog: other, and in general follow the widely-used [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 1.4](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

Opening a GitHub Issue detailing any unnaceptable behavior within this project is the preferred way to report problems; however if for any reason you wish to make a report privately, you may email **complete** details of the errant behavior, as well as **why** you believe the behavior is inappropriate, to shane@punderthings.com.  All reports will be treated as confidentially as practical (meaning: if I get a subpoena, I may have to turn over emails).
