# [Choose A Foundation](http://chooseafoundation.com/)

Inspired by GitHub's [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com/), I wanted to help FOSS communities take it to the next level of organization.  Thus, [Choose A Foundation](http://chooseafoundation.com/) - when your project starts growing, you need to define your governance and decide how to manage project (and contributor!) growth.  Choose A Foundation is here to provide non-judgemental suggestions of the most popular FOSS Foundations that accept new projects as member projects.

Looking for more foundations?  Head over to [FLOSS Foundations](https://flossfoundations.org/), a comprehensive directory and discussion list for foundation governance.
