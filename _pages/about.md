## About This Site

Inspired by GitHub's [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com/) website, I wanted to help FOSS communities take it to the next level of organization.  Thus, Choose A Foundation - when your project starts growing, you need to define your governance and decide how to manage project (and contributor!) growth.  Choose A Foundation is here to provide non-judgemental suggestions of the most popular FOSS Foundations that accept new projects as member projects.

This website includes:

- **Factual listings** of popular FOSS Foundations that host other open source projects, and that have an active submission program that allows new open source communities to join that Foundation.  Data in the Foundations listings is either sourced directly from their websites, or is provided by an official representative of the organization.
- **Explanations** of common open source terms, provided by Shane or from links to the many other fine open source people who help explain our ecosystem.
- **Advice** on how to approach communities (for companies), or how to approach companies (for communities), by Shane and [Punderthings℠ Consulting](http://punderthings.com/).
