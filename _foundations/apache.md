## About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees more than 350 leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server --the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than 680 individual Members and 6,000 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization, funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors including Alibaba Cloud Computing, ARM, Bloomberg, Budget Direct, Capital One, Cash Store, Cerner, Cloudera, Comcast, Confluent, Facebook, Google, Hortonworks, HP, Huawei, IBM, InMotion Hosting, iSigma, LeaseWeb, Microsoft, ODPi, PhoenixNAP, Pivotal, Private Internet Access, Produban, Red Hat, Serenata Flowers, Target, WANdisco, and Yahoo.

## How Individuals Can Get Involved {#individual}

The [Apache Community Development project](https://community.apache.org/) is here to help newcomers find their way around, learn about how Apache projects work.  The [Apache Projects Directory](https://projects.apache.org/) lists all the different projects hosted.

## How Projects Can Get Involved {#project}

Projects or communities wishing to join the ASF should submit a proposal to the [Apache Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/).

## How Companies Can Get Involved {#company}

As a vendor-neutral organization, the ASF does not allow corporations as entities to directly participate in project governance.  The ASF very much appreciates companies that choose to donate new codebases to the Apache Incubator, and to the many [Sponsors who donate](https://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html) to help fund Apache-wide operations, as well as a [Support Apache](http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html) call to action.
